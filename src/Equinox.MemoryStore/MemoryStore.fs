// Implements an in-memory store. This fulfils two goals:
// 1. Acts as a target for integration testing allowing end-to-end processing of a decision flow in an efficient test
// 2. Illustrates a minimal implementation of the Storage interface interconnects for the purpose of writing Store connectors
