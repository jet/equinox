Jet 😍 F# and Event Sourcing; open sourcing Equinox has been a long journey; we're _nearly_ there! Please refer to the [FAQ](README.md#FAQ) and [README.md](README.md) for background info _and (**especially while we remain pre-release**), the [Roadmap](#roadmap)_. While the repo is open, this is **not released**, it's a soft-launched open source repo at version 1.0; the 1.0 reflects (only) the fact its in production usage. There is absolutely an intention to make this be a proper open-source project; we're absolutely not making that claim right now.

- While [`dotnet new eqxweb -t`](https://github.com/jet/dotnet-templates) does provide the option to include a full-featured [TodoBackend](https://todobackend.com) per the spec, a more complete sample application is needed; see [#57](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/57)
- there is no proper step by step tutorial showing code and stored representations interleaved (there is a low level spec-example in [the docs](DOCUMENTATION.md#Programming-Model) in the interim)
- There is a placeholder [Roadmap](#roadmap) for now, which is really an unordered backlog.
- As noted in the [contributing section](README.md#contributing), we're simply not ready yet (we have governance models in place; this is purely a matter of conserving bandwidth, prioritising getting the system serviceable in terms of samples and documentation in advance of inviting people to evaluate)...

# Background reading

While there is no canonical book on doing Event Sourced Domain Modelling, there are some must read books which stand alone as timeless books in general but are also specifically relevant to the considerations involved in building a good Event-sourced model.

_Domain Driven Design, Eric Evans, 2003_ aka 'The Blue Book'; not a leisurely read but timeless and continues to be authoritative

_Domain Modelling Made Functional, Scott Wlaschin, 2018_; extremely well edited traversal of Domain Modelling in F# which is a pleasure to read. Does not talk about event sourcing, but is still very relevant.

_Implementing Domain Driven Design, Vaughn Vernon, 2013_; aka 'The Red Book'. Worked examples and a slightly different take on DDD (the appendix on Functional Event sourcing is not far from what we have around these parts; which is [not surprising given there's input from Jérémie Chassaing](https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/FsUno.Prod))

# Glossary

Event Sourcing is easier _and harder_ than you think. This document is not a tutorial, and you can and will make a mess on your first forays. This glossary attempts to map terminology from established documentation outside to terms used in this documentation.

Aggregate | Boundary within which a set of Invariants are to be preserved across a set of related Entities and Value Objects
Append | the act of adding Events reflecting a Decision to a Stream contingent on an Optimistic Concurrency Check
Command | Details representing intent to run a Decision process based on a Stream; may result in Events being Appended
CQRS | Command/Query Responsibility Segregation; Architectural principle critical to understand when building an Event Sourced System
Decision | Application logic which operates on a Command and a State. Can yield a response and/or Events to Append to the Stream in order to manifest the intent implied by the Command on Stream for this Aggregate - the rules it considers in doing so are in effect the Invariants of the Aggregate

# Programming Model

NB this has lots of room for improvement, having started as a placeholder in [#50](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/50); **improvements are absolutely welcome, as this is intended for an audience with diverse levels of familiarity with event sourcing in general, and Equinox in particular**.

In F#, independent of the Store being used, the Equinox programming model involves (largely by convention, see [FAQ](README.md#FAQ)), per aggregation of events on a given category of stream:

- `'state`: the rolling state maintained to enable Decisions or Queries to be made given a `'command` (not expected to be serializable or stored directly in a Store; can be held in a [.NET `MemoryCache`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.caching.memorycache))
- `'event`: a discriminated union representing all the possible Events from which a state can be `evolve`d (see `e`vents and `u`nfolds in the [Storage Model](cosmos-storage-model)). Typically the mapping of the json to an `'event` `c`ase is [driven by a `UnionContractEncoder`](https://eiriktsarpalis.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/a-contract-pattern-for-schemaless-datastores/)

- `initial: 'state`: the [implied] state of an empty stream

- `fold : 'state -> 'event seq -> 'state`: function used to fold one or more loaded (or proposed) events (real ones and/or unfolded ones) into a given running [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) of type `'state`
- `evolve: state -> 'event -> 'state` - the `folder` function from which `fold` is built, representing the application of a single delta that the `'event` implies for the model to the `state`. _Note: `evolve` is an implementation detail of a given Aggregate; `fold` is the function used in tests and used to parameterize the Category's storage configuration._

- `interpret: 'state -> 'command -> event' list`: responsible for _Deciding_ (in an [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) manner) how the intention represented by a `command` should (given the provided `state`) be reflected in terms of a) the `events` that should be written to the stream to record the decision b) any response to be returned to the invoker (NB returning a result likely represents a violation of the [CQS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation) and/or CQRS principles, [see Synchronous Query in the Glossary](glossary))

When using a Store with support for synchronous unfolds and/or snapshots, one will typically implement two
further functions in order to avoid having every `'event` in the stream be loaded and processed in order to
build the `'state` per Decision or Query  (versus a single cheap point read from CosmosDb to read the _tip_):

- `isOrigin: 'event -> bool`: predicate indicating whether a given `'event` is sufficient as a starting point i.e., provides sufficient information for the `evolve` function to yield a correct `state` without any preceding event being supplied to the `evolve`/`fold` functions
- `unfold: 'state -> 'event seq`: function used to render events representing the `'state` which facilitate short circuiting the building of `state`, i.e., `isOrigin` should be able to yield `true` when presented with this `'event`. (in some cases, the store implementation will provide a custom `AccessStrategy` where the `unfold` function should only produce a single `event`; where this is the case, typically this is referred to as `compact : 'state -> 'event`).

## Decision Flow

When running a decision process, we have the following stages:

1. establish a known `'state` ([as at](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/02/retroactive-future-event-sourced) a given Position in the stream of Events)
2. present the _request/command_ and the `state` to the `interpret` function in order to determine appropriate _events_ (can be many, or none) that represent the _decision_ in terms of events
3. append to the stream, _contingent on the stream still being in the same State/Position it was in step 1_

     a. if there is no conflict (nobody else decided anything since we decided what we'd do given that command and state), append the events to the stream (retaining the updated _position_ and _etag_)

     b. if there is a conflict, obtain the conflicting events [that other writers have produced] since the Position used in step 1, `fold` them into our `state`, and go back to 2 (aside: the CosmosDb stored procedure can send them back immediately at zero cost or latency, and there is [a proposal for EventStore to afford the same facility](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/issues/1652))

4. [if it makes sense for our scenario], hold the _state_, _position_ and _etag_ in our cache. When a Decision or Synchronous Query is needed, do a point-read of the _tip_ and jump straight to step 2 if nothing has been modified.

See [Cosmos Storage Model](#cosmos-storage-model) for a more detailed discussion of the role of the Sync Stored Procedure in step 3

## Canonical example Aggregate + Handler + Service

The following example is a minimal version of [the Favorites model](samples/Store/Domain/Favorites.fs), with shortcuts for brevity, that implements all the relevant functions above:

```fsharp
(* Event schemas *)

type Item = { id: int; name: string; added: DateTimeOffset } 
type Event =
    | Added of Item
    | Removed of itemId: int
    | Compacted of items: Item[]

(* State types/helpers *)

type State = Item list // NB IRL don't mix Event and State types
let is id x = x.id = id

(* Folding functions to build state from events *)

let evolve state = function
    | Compacted items -> List.ofArray items
    | Added item -> item :: state
    | Removed id -> state |> List.filter (is id)
let fold state = Seq.fold evolve state

(* Decision Processing to translate a Command's intent to Events that would Make It So *)

type Command =
    | Add of Item // IRL do not use Event records in Command types
    | Remove of itemId: int

let interpret command state =
    let has id = state |> List.exits (is id)
    match command with
    | Add item -> if has item.id then [] else [Added item]
    | Remove id -> if has id then [Removed id] else []

(* Optional: Unfold-related functions to allow establish state efficiently,
   ideally without having to read/fold all Events in a Stream *)

let unfold state =
    [Event.Compacted state]
let isOrigin = function
    | Compacted _ -> true
    | _ -> false

(* Relevant stream-level operations, 
   i.e. infrastructural concerns that are relevant for a given Stream
   (as dictated by the needs of the `Service`) are normally wrapped up as a `Handler`;
   typically a Transient instance spun up in the context of a given operation being processed *)

type Handler(log, stream, ?maxAttempts) =
    let inner = Equinox.Handler(fold, log, stream, maxAttempts = defaultArg maxAttempts 3)
    member __.Execute command : Async<unit> =
        inner.Transact(interpret command)
    member __.Read : Async<string list> =
        inner.Query id

(* The Service then defines operations in business terms with minimal reference to Equinox terms
   or need to talk in terms of infrastructure; typically the service is stateless and can be a Singleton *)

type Service(log, resolveStream) =
    let (|AggregateId|) (id: ClientId) = Equinox.AggregateId("Favorites", ClientId.toStringN id)
    let (|Stream|) (AggregateId id) = Handler(log, resolveStream id)
    member __.Execute(Stream stream, command) =
        stream.Execute command
    member __.Favorite(Stream stream, skus) =
        stream.Execute(Command.Favorite(DateTimeOffset.Now, skus))
    member __.Unfavorite(Stream stream, skus) =
        stream.Execute(Command.Unfavorite skus)
    member __.List(Stream stream): Async<Events.Favorited []> =
        stream.Read
```

# Equinox Architectural Overview

There are virtually unlimited ways to build an event-sourced model. It's critical that, for any set of components to be useful, that they are designed in a manner where one combines small elements to compose a whole, [versus trying to provide a hardwired end-to-end 'framework'](https://youtu.be/LDW0QWie21s?t=1928).

While going the library route leaves plenty seams needing to be tied together at the point of consumption (with resulting unavoidable complexity), it's unavoidable if one is to provide a system that can work in the real world.

This section outlines key concerns that the Equinox [Programming Model](#programming-model) is specifically taking a view on, and those that it is going to particular ends to leave open.

## Concerns leading to need for a programming model

F#, out of the box has a very relevant feature set for building Domain models in an event sourced fashion (DUs, persistent data structures, total matching, list comprehensions, async builders etc). However, there are still lots of ways to split the process of folding the events, encoding them, deciding events to produce etc.

In the general case, it doesnt really matter what way one opts to model the events, folding and decision processing.

However, given one has a specific store (or set of stores) in mind for the events, a number of key aspects need to be taken into consideration:

1. Coding/encoding events - Per aggregate or system, there is commonality in how one might wish to encode and/or deal with versioning of event representations. Per store, the most efficient way to bridge to that concern can vary. Per domain and encoding system, the degree to which one wants to unit or integration test this codec process will vary.

2. Caching - Per store, there are different tradeoffs/benefits for Caching. Per system, caching may or may not even make sense. For some stores, it makes sense to integrate caching into the primary storage.

3. Snapshotting - The store and/or the business need may provide a strong influence on whether or not (and how) one might employ a snapshotting mechanism.

## Store-specific concerns mapping to the programming model

This sections enumerates key concerns feeding into how Stores in general, and specific concrete Stores bind to the [Programming Model](programming-model):

### EventStore

TL;DR caching not really needed, storing snapshots has many considerations in play, projections built in 

Overview: EventStore is a mature and complete system, explicitly designed to address key aspects of building an event-sourced system. There are myriad bindings for multiple languages and various programming models. The docs present various ways to do snapshotting. The projection system provides ways in which to manage snapshotting, projections, building read models etc.

Key aspects relevant to the Equinox programming model:

- In general, EventStore provides excellent caching and performance characteristics intrinsically by virtue of its design
- Projections can be managed by either tailing streams (including the synthetic `$all` stream) or using the Projections facility - there's no obvious reason to wrap it, aside from being able to uniformly target CosmosDb (i.e. one could build an `Equinox.EventStore.Projection` library and an `eqx project stats es` with very little code).
- In general event streams should be considered append only, with no mutations or deletes
- For snapshotting, one can either maintain a separate stream with a maximum count or TTL rule, or include faux _Compaction_ events in the normal streams (to make it possible to combine reading of events and a snapshot in a single roundtrip). The latter is presently implemented in `Equinox.EventStore`
- While there is no generic querying facility, the APIs are designed in such a manner that it's generally possible to achieve any typically useful event access pattern needed in an optimal fashion (projections, catchup subscriptions, backward reads, caching)
- While EventStore allows either json or binary data, its generally accepted that json (presented as UTF-8 byte arrays) is a good default for reasons of interoperability (the projections facility also strongly implies json)

### Azure CosmosDb concerns

TL;DR caching can optimize RU consumption significantly. Due to the intrinsic ability to mutate easily, the potential to integrate rolling snapshots into core storage is clear. Providing ways to cache and snapshot matter a lot on CosmosDb, as lowest-common-demominator queries loading lots of events cost in performance and cash. The specifics of how you use the changefeed matters more than one might thing from the CosmosDb high level docs.

Overview: CosmosDb has been in production for >5 years and is a mature Document database. The initial DocumentDb offering is at this point a mere projected programming model atop a generic Document data store. Its changefeed mechanism affords a base upon which one can manage projections, but there is no directly provided mechanism that lends itself to building Projections that map directly to EventStore's facilties in this regard (i.e., there is nowhere to maintain consumer offsts in the store itself).

Key aspects relevant to the Equinox programming model:

- CosmosDb has pervasive optimization feedback per call in the form of a Request Charge attached to each and every action. Working to optimize one's request charges per scenario is critical both in terms of the effect it has on the amount of Request Units/s one you need to preprovision (which translates directly to costs on your bill), and then live predictably within if one is not to be throttled with 429 responses. In general, the request charging structure can be considered a very strong mechanical sympathy feedback signal
- Point reads of single documents based on their identifier are charged as 1 RU plus a price per KB and are optimal. Queries, even ones returning that same single document, have significant overhead and hence are to be avoided
- One key mechanism CosmosDb provides to allow one to work efficiently is that any point-read request where one supplies a valid `etag` is charged at 1 RU, regardless of the size one would be transferring in the case of a cache miss (the other key benefit of using this is that it avoids unecessarly clogging of the bandwidth, and optimal latencies due to no unnecessary data transfers)
- Indexing things surfaces in terms of increased request charges; at scale, each indexing hence needs to be justified
- Similarly to EventStore, the default ARS encoding CosmosDb provides, together with interoperability concerns, means that straight json makes sense as an encoding form for events (UTF-8 arrays)
- Collectively, the above implies (arguably counterintuitively) that using the powerful generic querying facility that CosmosDb provides should actually be a last resort.
- See [Cosmos Storage Model](#cosmos-storage-model) for further information on the specific encoding used, informed by these concerns.
- Because reads, writes _and updates_ of items in the Tip document are charged based on the size of the document in units of 1KB, it's worth compressing and/or storing snapshots ouside of the Tip-document (while those factors are also a concern with EventStore, the key difference is their direct effect of charges in this case).

The implications of how the changefeed mechanism works also have implications for how events and snapshots should be encoded and/or stored:

- Each write results in a potential cost per changefeed consumer, hence one should minimize changefeed consumers count
- Each update of a document can have the same effect in terms of Request Charges incurred in tracking the changefeed (each write results in a document "moving to the tail" in the consumption order - if multiple writes occur within a polling period, you'll only see the last one)
- The ChangeFeedProcessor presents a programming model which needs to maintain a position. Typically one should store that in an auxilliary collection in order to avoid feedback and/or interaction between the changefeed and those writes

It can be useful to consider keeping snapshots in the auxilliary collection employed by the changefeed in order to optimize the interrelated concerns of not reading data redundantly, and not feeding back into the oneself (although having separate roundtrips obviously has implications).
 
# Cosmos Storage Model

This article provides a walkthrough of how `Equinox.Cosmos` encodes, writes and reads records from a stream under its control.

The code (see [source](src/Equinox.Cosmos/Cosmos.fs#L6)) contains lots of comments and is intended to be read - this just provides some background.

## Batches

Events are stored in immutable batches consisting of:

- `p`artitionKey: `string` // stream identifier, e.g. "Cart-{guid}"
- `i`ndex: `int64` // base index position of this batch (`0` for first event in a stream)
- `n`extIndex: `int64` // base index ('i') position value of the next record in the stream - NB this _always_ corresponds to `i`+`e.length` (in the case of the `Tip` record, there won't actually be such a record yet)
- `id`: `string` // same as `i` (CosmosDb forces every doc to have one[, and it must be a `string`])
- `e`vents: `Event[]` // (see next section) typically there is one item in the array (can be many if events are small, for RU and performance/efficiency reasons; RU charges are per 1024 byte block)
- `ts` // CosmosDb-intrinsic last updated date for this record (changes when replicated etc, hence see `t` below)

## Events

Per `Event`, we have the following:

- `c`ase - the case of this union in the Discriminated Union of Events this stream bears (aka Event Type)
- `d`ata - json data (CosmosDb maintains it as actual json; you are free to index it and/or query based on that if desired)
- `m`etadata - carries ancillary information for an event; also json
- `t` - creation timestamp 

## Tip [Batch]

The _tip_ is always readable via a point-read, as the `id` has a fixed, well-known value: `"-1"`). It uses the same base layout as the aforementioned Batch (`Tip` *isa* `Batch`), adding the following:

- `id`: always `-1` so one can reference it in a point-read GET request and not pay the cost and latency associated with a full indexed query
- `_etag`: CosmosDb-managed field updated per-touch (facilitates `NotModified` result, see below)
- `u`: Array of _unfold_ed events based on a point-in-time _state_ (see _State, Snapshots, Events and Unfolds_, _Unfolded Events_  and `unfold` in the programming model section). Not indexed. While the data is json, the actual `d`ata and `m`etadata fields are compressed and encoded as base64 (and hence can not be queried in any reasonable manner).

# State, Snapshots, Events and Unfolds

In an Event Sourced system, we typically distinguish between the following basic elements

- _Events_ - Domain Events representing real world events that have occurred (always past-tense; it's happened and is not up for debate), reflecting the domain as understood by domain experts - see [Event Storming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming). Examples: _The customer favorited the item_, _the customer add SKU Y to their saved for later list_, _A charge of $200 was submitted successfully with transaction id X_.

- _State_ - derived representations established from Events. A given set of code in an environment will, in service of some decision making process, interpret the Events as implying particular state changes in a model. If we change the code slightly or add a field, you wouldn't necessarily expect a version of your code from a year ago to generate you equivalent state that you can simply blast into your object model and go. (But you can easily and safely hold a copy in memory as long as your process runs as this presents no such interoperability or versioning concerns). State is not necessarily always serializable, nor should it be.

- _Snapshots_ - A snapshot is an intentionally roundtrippable version of a State, that can be saved and restored. Typically one would do this to save the (latency, roundtrips, RUs, deserialization and folding) cost of loading all the Events in a long running sequence of Events to re-establish the State. The [EventStore folks have a great walkthrough on Rolling Snapshots](https://eventstore.org/docs/event-sourcing-basics/rolling-snapshots/index.html).

- Projections - the term projection is *heavily* overloaded, meaning anything from the proceeds of a SELECT statement, the result of a `map` operation, an EventStore projection, an event being propagated via Kafka (no, further examples are not required!).

.... and:

- Unfolds - the term `unfold` is based on the well known 'standard' FP function of that name, bearing the signature `'state -> 'event seq`. **=> For `Equinox.Cosmos`, one might say `unfold` yields _projection_ s as _event_ s to _snapshot_ the _state_ as at that _position_ in the _stream_**.

## Generating and saving `unfold`ed events

Periodically, along with writing the _events_ that a _decision function_ yields to represent the implications of a _command_ given the present _state_, we also `unfold` the resulting `state'` and supply those to the `Sync` function too. The `unfold` function takes the `state` and projects one or more snapshot-events that can be used to re-establish a state equivalent to that we have thus far derived from watching the events on the stream. Unlike normal events, `unfold`ed events do not get replicated to other systems, and can also be jetisonned at will (we also compress them rather than storing them as fully expanded json).

_NB, in the present implementation, `u`nfolds are generated, transmitted and updated upon every write; this makes no difference from a Request Charge perspective, but is clearly suboptimal due to the extra computational effort and network bandwidth consumption. This will likely be optimized by exposing controls on the frequency at which `unfold`s are triggered_

# Reading from the Storage Model

The dominant pattern is that reads request _Tip_  with an `IfNoneMatch` precondition citing the _etag_ it bore when we last saw it. That, when combined with a cache means one of the following happens when a reader is trying to establish the _state_ of a _stream_ prior to processing a _Command_:

- `NotModified` (depending on workload, can be the dominant case) - for `1` RU, minimal latency and close-to-`0` network bandwidth, we know the present state
- `NotFound` (there's nothing in the stream) - for equivalently low cost (`1` RU), we know the _state_ is `initial`
- `Found` - (if there are multiple writers and/or we don't have a cached version) - for the minimal possible cost (a point read, not a query), we have all we need to establish the state:-
    `i`: a version number
    `e`: events since that version number
    `u`: unfolded (auxiliary) events computed at the same time as the batch of events was sent (aka inforamlly as snapshots) - (these enable us to establish the `state` without further queries or roundtrips to load and fold all preceding events)

## Building a state from the Storage Model and/or the Cache

Given a stream with:

```json
[
    { "id":0, "i":0, "e": [{"c":"c1", "d":"d1"}]},
    { "id":1, "i":1, "e": [{"c":"c2", "d":"d2"}]},
    { "id":2, "i":2, "e": [{"c":"c2", "d":"d3"}]},
    { "id":3, "i":3, "e": [{"c":"c1", "d":"d4"}]},
    { "id":-1,
        "i": 4,
        "e": [{"i":4, "c":"c3", "d":"d5"}],
        "u": [{"i":4, "c":"s1", "d":"s5Compressed"}, {"i":3, "c":"s2", "d":"s4Compressed"}],
        "_etag": "etagXYZ"
    }
]
```

If we have `state4` based on the events up to `{i:3, c:c1, d: d4}` and the index document, we can produce the `state` by folding in a variety of ways:

- `fold initial [ C1 d1; C2 d2; C3 d3; C1 d4; C3 d5 ]` (but would need a query to load the first 2 batches, with associated RUs and roundtrips)
- `fold state4 [ C3 d5 ]` (only need to pay to transport the _tip_ document as a point read)
- (if `isOrigin (S1 s5)` = `true`): `fold initial [S1 s5]` (point read + transport + decompress `s5`)
- (if `isOrigin (S2 s4)` = `true`): `fold initial [S2 s4; C3 d5]` (only need to pay to transport the _tip_ document as a point read and decompress `s4` and `s5`)

If we have `state3` based on the events up to `{i:3, c:c1, d: d4}`, we can produce the `state` by folding in a variety of ways:

- `fold initial [ C1 d1; C2 d2; C3 d3; C1 d4; C3 d5 ]` (but query, roundtrips)
- `fold state3 [C1 d4 C3 d5]` (only pay for point read+transport)
- `fold initial [S2 s4; C3 d5]` (only pay for point read+transport)
- (if `isOrigin (S1 s5)` = `true`): `fold initial [S1 s5]` (point read + transport + decompress `s5`)
- (if `isOrigin (S2 s4)` = `true`): `fold initial [S2 s4; C3 d5]` (only need to pay to transport the _tip_ document as a point read and decompress `s4` and `s5`)

If we have `state5` based on the events up to `C3 d5`, and (being the writer, or a recent reader), have the etag: `etagXYZ`, we can do a `HTTP GET` with `etag: IfNoneMatch etagXYZ`, which will return `302 Not Modified` with < 1K of data, and a charge of `1.00` RU allowing us to derive the state as:

- `state5`

See [Programming Model](#programing-model) for what happens in the application based on the events presented.

# Sync stored procedure

This covers what the most complete possible implementation of the JS Stored Procedure (see [source](https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/tip-isa-batch/src/Equinox.Cosmos/Cosmos.fs#L302)) does when presented with a batch to be written. (NB The present implementation is slightly simplified; see [source](src/Equinox.Cosmos/Cosmos.fs#L303).

The `sync` stored procedure takes a document as input which is almost identical to the format of the _`Tip`_ batch (in fact, if the stream is found to be empty, it is pretty much the template for the first document created in the stream). The request includes the following elements:

- `expectedVersion`: the position the requestor has based their [proposed] events on (no, [providing an `etag` to save on Request Charges is not possible in the Stored Proc](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53355886/azure-cosmosdb-stored-procedure-ifmatch-predicate))
- `e`: array of Events (see Event, above) to append iff the expectedVersion check is fulfilled
- `u`: array of `unfold`ed events (aka snapshots) that supersede items with equivalent `c`ase values  
- `maxEvents`: the maximum number of events in an individual batch prior to starting a new one. For example:

  - if `e` contains 2 events, the _tip_ document's `e` has 2 documents and the `maxEvents` is `5`, the events get appended onto the tip
  - if the total length including the new `e`vents would exceed `maxEvents`, the Tip is 'renamed' (gets its `id` set to `i.toString()`) to become a batch, and the new events go into the new Tip-Batch, the _tip_ gets frozen as a `Batch`, and the new request becomes the _tip_ (as an atomic transaction on the server side)

- (PROPOSAL/FUTURE) `thirdPartyUnfoldRetention`: how many events to keep before the base (`i`) of the batch if required by lagging `u`nfolds which would otherwise fall out of scope as a result of the appends in this batch (this will default to `0`, so for example if a writer says maxEvents `10` and there is an `u`nfold based on an event more than `10` old it will be removed as part of the appending process)
- (PROPOSAL/FUTURE): adding an `expectedEtag` would enable competing writers to maintain and update `u`nfold data in a consistent fashion (backign off and retrying in the case of conflict, _without any events being written per state change_)

# Equinox.Cosmos.Core.Events

The `Equinox.Cosmos.Core` namespace provides a lower level API that can be used to manipulate events stored within a Azure CosmosDb using optimized native access patterns.

The higher level APIs (i.e. not `Core`), as demonstrated by the `dotnet new` templates are recommended to be used in the general case, as they provide the following key benefits:

- Domain logic is store-agnostic, leaving it easy to:
  - Unit Test in isolation (verifying decisions produce correct events)
  - Integration test using the `MemoryStore`, where relevant

- Decouples encoding/decoding of events from the decision process of what events to write (means your Domain layer does not couple to a specific storage layer or encoding mechanism)
- Enables efficient caching and/or snapshotting (providing Equinox with `fold`, `initial`, `isOrigin`, `unfold` and a codec allows it to manage this efficiently)
- Provides Optimistic Concurrency Control with retries in the case of conflicting events

## Example Code

```fsharp

open Equinox.Cosmos.Core.Events
// open MyCodecs.Json // example of using specific codec which can yield UTF-8 byte arrays from a type using `Json.toBytes` via Fleece or similar

type EventData with
    static member FromT eventType value = EventData.FromUtf8Bytes(eventType, Json.toBytes value)

// Load connection sring from your Key Vault (example here is the CosmosDb simulator's well known key)
let connectionString: string = "AccountEndpoint=https://localhost:8081;AccountKey=C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==;"

// Forward to Log (you can use `Log.Logger` and/or `Log.ForContext` if your app uses Serilog already)
let outputLog = LoggerConfiguration().WriteTo.NLog().CreateLogger()
// Serilog has a `ForContext<T>()`, but if you are using a `module` for the wiring, you might create a tagged logger like this:
let gatewayLog = outputLog.ForContext(Serilog.Core.Constants.SourceContextPropertyName, "Equinox")

// When starting the app, we connect (once)
let connector : Equinox.Cosmos.EqxConnector =
    EqxConnector(
        requestTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds 5.,
        maxRetryAttemptsOnThrottledRequests = 1,
        maxRetryWaitTimeInSeconds = 3,
        log=gatewayLog)
let cnx = connector.Connect("Application.CommandProcessor", Discovery.FromConnectionString connectionString) |> Async.RunSynchronously

// If storing in a single collection, one specifies the db and collection
// alternately use the overload which defers the mapping until the stream one is writing to becomes clear
let coll = EqxCollections("databaseName","collectionName")
let eqxCtx = EqxContext(cnx, coll, gatewayLog)

//
// Write an event
//

let expectedSequenceNumber = 0 // new stream
let streamName, eventType, eventJson = "stream-1", "myEvent", Request.ToJson event
let eventData = EventData.fromT(eventType, eventJson) |> Array.singleton

let! res =
    Events.append
        eqxCtx
        streamName 
        expectedSequenceNumber 
        eventData
match res with
| AppendResult.Ok -> ()
| c -> failwithf "conflict %A" c
```

# Projectors

See [this medium post regarding some patterns used at Jet in this space](https://medium.com/@eulerfx/scaling-event-sourcing-at-jet-9c873cac33b8) for a broad overview of the reasons one might consider employing a projection system.

# `Equinox.Cosmos` Projection facility

 An integral part of the `Equinox.Cosmos` featureset is the ability to project events based on the [Azure DocumentDb ChangeFeed mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed). Key elements involved in realizing this are:
- the [storage model needs to be designed in such a way that the aforementioned processor can do its job efficiently](https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#cosmos-storage-model)
- there needs to be an active ChangeFeed Processor per collection which monitors events being written, tracking the position of the most recently propagated events

In CosmosDb, every document lives within a [logical partition, which is then hosted by a variable number of processor instances entitled _physical partitions_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data) (`Equinox.Cosmos` documents pertaining to an individual stream bear the same partition key in order to ensure correct ordering guarantees for the purposes of projection). Each front end processor has responsibility for a particular subset range of the partition key space.

The ChangeFeed’s real world manifestation is as a long running Processor per frontend processor that repeatedly tails a query across the set of documents being managed by a given partition host (subject to topology changes - new processors can come and go, with the assigned ranges shuffling to balance the load per processor). e.g. if you allocate 30K RU/s to a collection, it will have 3 processors, each handling 1/3 of the partition key space, and running a change feed from that is a matter of maintaining 3 continuous queries, with a continuation token each.

## Effect of ChangeFeed on Request Charges

It should be noted that the ChangeFeed is not special-cased by CosmosDb itself in any meaningful way - something somewhere is going to be calling a DocumentDb API queries, paying Request Charges fo the privilege (even a tail request based on a continuation token yielding zero documents incurs a charge). Its important to consider that every event written by `Equinox.Cosmos` into the CosmosDb collection will induce an approximately equivalent cost due to the fact that a freshly inserted document will be included in the next batch propagated by the Processor (each update of a document also ‘moves’ that document from it’s present position in the change order past the the tail of the ChangeFeed). Thus each insert/update also induces an (unavoidable) request charge based on the fact that the document will be included aggregate set of touch documents being surfaced per batch transferred from the ChangeFeed (charging is per KiB or part thereof).

## Change Feed Processors

The CosmosDb ChangeFeed’s real world manifestation is a continuous query per DocumentDb Physical Partition node processor.

For .NET, this is wrapped in a set of APIs presented within the standard `Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDb[.Core]` APIset (for example, the [`Sagan` library](https://github.com/jet/sagan) is built based on this, _but there be dragons_).

A ChangeFeed _Processor_ consists of (per CosmosDb processor/range)
- a host process running somewhere that will run the query and then do something with the results before marking off progress
- a continuous query across the set of documents that fall within the partition key range hosted by a given physical partition host

The implementation in this repo uses [Microsoft’s .NET `ChangeFeedProcessor` implementation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-changefeedprocessor-dotnet), which is a proven component used for diverse purposes including as the underlying substrate for various Azure Functions wiring.

See the [PR that added the initial support for CosmosDb Projections](https://github.com/jet/equinox/pull/87) and [the QuickStart](README.md#quickstart) for instructions.

# Feeding to Kafka

While [Kafka is not for Event Sourcing](https://medium.com/serialized-io/apache-kafka-is-not-for-event-sourcing-81735c3cf5c), if you have the scale to run automate the care and feeding of Kafka infrastructure, it can a great toof for the job of Replicating events and/or Rich Events in a scalable manner.

The [Apache Kafka intro docs](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) provide a clear terse overview of the design and attendant benefits this brings to bear.

As noted in the [Effect of ChangeFeed on Request Charges](https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#effect-of-changefeed-on-request-charges) section, it can make sense to replicate the ChangeFeed to Kafka purely from the point of view of optimising request charges (and not needing to consider projections when considering how to scale up provisioning for load). Other benefits are mechanical sympathy based - Kafka is very often the right tool for the job in scaling out traversal of events for a variety of use cases.

See the [PR that added the initial support for CosmosDb Projections](https://github.com/jet/equinox/pull/87) and [the QuickStart](README.md#quickstart) for instructions.

It should be noted that the `Equinox.Projection.Kafka` batteries included projector/consumer library targets the `Confluent.Kafka` `1.0.0-*` series (as opposed to the present stable `0.11.4` thru `6` editions). There are significant breaking changes between the `0.` and `1.` releases, and there is no plan to support `0.1.x` targeting in this codebase (PR 87's history does include a passing library and tests targeting `0.11.4` for history buffs).

# Roadmap

# Very likely to happen and/or people looking at it:

- Extend samples and templates; see [#57](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/57)
- Enable snapshots to be stored outside of the main collection in `Equinox.Cosmos` see [#61](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/61)

# Things that are incomplete and/or require work

This is a very loose laundry list of items that have occurred to us to do, given infinite time. No conclusions of likelihood of starting, finishing, or even committing to adding a feature should be inferred, but most represent things that would be likely to be accepted into the codebase (please raise Issues first though ;) ).

## Wouldn't it be nice - `Equinox.EventStore`:

EventStore, and it's Store adapter is the most proven and is pretty feature rich relative to the need of consumers to date. Some things remain though:

- Provide a low level walking events in F# API akin to `Equinox.Cosmos.Core.Events`; this would allow consumers to jump from direct use of `EventStore.ClientAPI` -> `Equinox.EventStore.Core.Events` -> `Equinox.Handler` (with the potential to be able to use alternate stores once one gets to using `Equinox.Handler` (which is store Agnostic))
- Get conflict handling as efficient and predictable as for `Equinox.Cosmos` https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/28
- provide for snapshots to be stored out of the stream, and loaded in a customizable manner in a manner analogous to [the proposed comparable `Equinox.Cosmos` facility](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/61).

## Wouldn't it be nice - `Equinox`:

- While the plan is to support linux and MacOS, there are skipped tests wrt Mono etc. In terms of non-Windows developer experience, there's plenty scope for improvement.
- Performance tuning for non-store-specific logic; no perf tuning has been done to date (though some of the Store/Domain implementations do show perf-optimized fold implementation techniques). While in general the work is I/O bound, there are definitely opportunities to use `System.IO.Pipelines` etc, and the `MemoryStore` and CLI gives a good testbed to drive this improvement.

## Wouldn't it be nice - `Equinox.Cosmos`:

- Multiple writers support for `u`nfolds (at present a `sync` completely replaces the unfolds in the Tip; this will be extended by having the stored proc maintain the union of the unfolds in play (both for semi-related services and for blue/green deploy scenarios); TBD how we decide when a union that's no longer in use gets removed)
- performance improvements in loading logic
- `_etag`-based consistency checks?
- Perf tuning of `JObject` vs `UTF-8` arrays

## Wouldn't it be nice - `Equinox.SqlStreamStore`: See [#62](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/62)
