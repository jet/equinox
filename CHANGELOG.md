# Changelog

The repo is versioned based on [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) using the tiny-but-mighty [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) from [@adamralph](https://github.com/adamralph). [See here](https://github.com/adamralph/minver#how-it-works) for more information on how it works.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The `Unreleased` section name is replaced by the expected version of next release. A stable version's log contains all changes between that version and the previous stable version (can duplicate the prereleases logs).
