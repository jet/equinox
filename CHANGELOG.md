# Changelog

The repo is versioned based on [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) using the tiny-but-mighty [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) from [@adamralph](https://github.com/adamralph). [See here](https://github.com/adamralph/minver#how-it-works) for more information on how it works.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The `Unreleased` section name is replaced by the expected version of next release. A stable version's log contains all changes between that version and the previous stable version (can duplicate the prereleases logs).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- Uses MinVer 1.0.0 [internally] to compute package versions (was `rc.1`, `beta.4` along the way)
- Rename `Equinox.Projection.Codec` NuGet to `Equinox.Projection` (no code changes)
- Renamespace and separate `Equinox.Codec` to `Equinox.Codec.NewtonsoftJson` and `Equinox.Codec.Custom` (in preparation for [#113](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/113)) HT @szer

### Added

- Provide capability to access `Metadata` and `EventNumber`/`Index` re [#102](https://github.com/jet/equinox/issues/102)

### Changed

### Removed

- Extract `Equinox.Projection.Kafka` and its integration tests to become [`Jet.ConfluentKafka.FSharp` v `1.0.0-preview1`](https://github.com/jet/Jet.ConfluentKafka.FSharp/tree/v1); retargeted `Equinox.Tool` to use same.
