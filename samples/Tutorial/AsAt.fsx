// Example of using the FsCodec up/down conversion mechanism to access the underlying `Index` of the event in the stream
//   in order to be able to query to obtain an as-at balance
// For a more realistic and detailed example, see https://andrewcmeier.com/bi-temporal-event-sourcing

// NOTES
// - relying on the Index in a model in this manner is in no way common practice (the above tutorial uses first class
//   identifiers inside the events to label points in time)
// - exposing the Index and/or version externally as part of one's API is rarely a good solution either; you ideally want
//   incoming commands to embody intent expressed in terms of a Domain Model rather than having it be coupled to details
//   of the underlying storage and/or versioning thereof.
// - the same general point applies to over-using querying of streams for read purposes as we do here;
//   applying CQRS principles can often lead to a better model regardless of raw necessity

// dotnet build samples/Tutorial before attempting to send this to FSI with Alt-Enter
