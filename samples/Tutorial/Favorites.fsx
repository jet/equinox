(* Define the events that will be saved in the stream *)

// Note using strings and DateTimes etc as Event payloads is not supported for .CosmosStore or .EventStore using the
// TypeShape IUnionContract based Codec support
// i.e. typically records are used for the Event Payloads even in cases where you feel you'll only ever have a single primitive value

type Event =
    | Added of string
    | Removed of string
// No IUnionContract or Codec required as we're using a custom encoder in this example
//    interface TypeShape.UnionContract.IUnionContract

let initial : State = []
let evolve state = function
    | Added sku -> sku :: state
    | Removed sku -> state |> List.filter (fun x -> x <> sku)

(* With the basic Events and `fold` defined, we have enough to build the state from the Events:- *)

let initialState = initial
//val initialState : string list = []

let favesCba = fold initialState [| Added "a"; Added "b"; Added "c" |]
//val favesCba : string list = ["c"; "b"; "a"]

 * DECISIONS / COMMANDS
 *)

(* Now we can build a State from the Events, we can map from an external need/intent to how we'd represent any changes
   needed to out current state to reflect that *)

(* ^ Note we don't yield events if there is no state change required
   This is referred to by the term idempotency https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence
   In summary, re-running the same request immediately should tend to have zero effect and not do any write trip to the store *)

(*
 * CATEGORY
 *)

// Each store has a <Store>Category that is used to resolve IStream instances binding to a specific stream in a specific store

// A Decider lets you Transact or Query based on a state

// That Decider is then used as a building block

// each time you want to do something against the stream, you do that via the Decider that's been established over it:

clientADecider.Transact(Decisions.add "b") |> Async.RunSynchronously
// Idempotency comes into play if we run it twice:
clientADecider.Transact(Decisions.add "b") |> Async.RunSynchronously

(* Read the current state *)

// In practice, you don't do a chain of actions against a given decider - you build a Service method that
// - obtains the Decider
// - applies the relevant decision or render function to execute the command and/or read the state
