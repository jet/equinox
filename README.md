Equinox
=======
A lightweight set of infrastructure, examples and tests providing a consistent approach to Event-sourced Decision processing in F# against multiple ordered stream stores.

Features
--------
- Domain tests can be written directly against the models without any need to involve Equinox.
- Events are declaratively encoded using `Equinox.UnionCodec`, which is a thin veneer over `Typeshape`'s `UnionEncoder`, providing for serializer agnostic schema evolution with minimal boilerplate
- Independent of the stored used, Equinox provides for caching using the .NET `MemoryCache` to minimize roundtrips, latency and bandwidth / request charges costs by maintaining the folded state without any explicit code within the Domain Model
- Logging is both high performance and pluggable (using [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog) to your hosting context (we feed log info to  Splunk atm and feed metrics embedded in the LogEvent Properties to Prometheus; see relevant tests for examples)
- Compaction support: Command processing can by optimized by employing in-stream 'compaction' events in service of the following ends:
	- no additional roundtrips to the store needed at either the Load or Sync points in the flow
	- support, (via `UnionEncoder`) for the maintenance of multiple co-existing snapshot schemas in a given stream (A snapshot isa Event)
	- compaction events typically do not get deleted in EventStore
- Extracted from working software; currently used for all data storage within Jet's API gateway and Cart processing.
- Significant test coverage for core facilities, and per Storage system.

Elements
--------
Elements are delivered as multitargeted Nuget packages targeting `net461` (F# 3.1+) and `netstandard2.0` (F# 4.5+) profiles; each of the constituent elements is designed to be easily swappable as dictated by the task at hand. Each of the components can be inlined or customized easily:-

- `Equinox.Handler` (Nuget: `Equinox`, depends on `Serilog` (but no specific Serilog sinks, i.e. you can forward to `NLog` etc)): Store-agnostic Decision flow runner that manages the optimistic concurrency protocol
- `Equinox.Codec` (Nuget: `Equinox.Codec`, depends on `TypeShape`, (optionally) `Newtonsoft.Json >= 11.0.2` but can support any serializer): a scheme for the serializing Events modelled as an F# Discriminated Union with the following capabilities:
	- independent of any specific serializer
	- allows tagging of Discriminated Union cases in a versionable manner with low-dependency `DataMember(Name=` tags using [TypeShape](https://github.com/eiriktsarpalis/TypeShape)'s [`UnionEncoder`](https://github.com/eiriktsarpalis/TypeShape/blob/master/tests/TypeShape.Tests/UnionEncoderTests.fs)
- `Equinox.Cosmos` (Nuget: `Equinox.Cosmos`, depends on `System.Runtime.Caching`, `FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq`, `TypeShape`, ): Production-strength Azure CosmosDb Adapter with integrated transactional snapshotting facilitating optimal read performance in terms of latency and RU costs, instrumented to the degree necessitated by Jet's production monitoring requirements.
- `Equinox.EventStore` (Nuget: `Equinox.EventStore`, depends on `EventStore.Client[Api.NetCore] >= 4`, `System.Runtime.Caching`, `FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq`, `TypeShape`): Production-strength [EventStore](http://geteventstore.com) Adapter instrumented to the degree necessitated by Jet's production monitoring requirements
- `Equinox.MemoryStore` (Nuget: `Equinox.MemoryStore`): In-memory store for integration testing/performance baselining
- `Samples/Store` (in this repo): Example domain types reflecting examples of how one applies Equinox to a diverse set of stream-based models
- `Equinox.Bench` (in this repo): Scenario runner that facilitates running representative load tests composed of transactions in `Samples/Store` against each backend store; this allows perf tuning and measurement in terms of both latency and transaction charge aspects.
